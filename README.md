# TASKS

## Task 1 - Exploring Supervised Machine Learning

    In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
    This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data.
